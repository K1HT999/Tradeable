Algorithmic Trading System: TRADEABLE

This repository demonstrates a complete quantitative trading workflow, separated into two distinct environments:
I spent hundreds of hours developing both of these, still many many many improvements to come

1.  Research & Backtesting(/Tradeable_backtester): A vectorized engine for hypothesis testing, signal validation, and parameter optimization.
2.  Live Execution(/Tradeable_live)**: An asynchronous, live execution engine designed for strategy implementation.


*Note: Proprietary alpha logic has been redacted in both modules.*
